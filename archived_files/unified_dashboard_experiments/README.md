# Unified Dashboard Experiments Archive

**Date Archived:** August 8, 2025
**Reason:** Reverting to pre-unified dashboard state due to mixed design issues

## What was archived:
- `unified_dashboard.html` - Main unified template attempt
- `unified_dashboard_backup_before_fix.html` - Initial backup
- `unified_dashboard_before_final_fix.html` - Pre-final fix version
- `unified_dashboard_final.html` - Final unified version
- `unified_dashboard_fixed.html` - Last attempt at fixes

## Context:
These files were created during an attempt to unify the dashboard and child profile templates into a single template that could handle both modes. While functional, the implementation resulted in mixed design patterns and inconsistent layouts.

## Restored State:
- Dashboard uses: `templates/dashboard.html` with component architecture
- Child profiles use: `templates/planner/childEntries.html` with three-column layout
- URLs restored to separate view functions: `dashboard()` and `child_entries()`

## If needed again:
These templates contain valuable learning and can be referenced for future unification attempts. The main challenges were:
1. Different responsive breakpoints between modes
2. Mixed inline vs. component-based architecture
3. Layout structural differences between dashboard and child modes

## Working System Restored:
✅ Separate, proven templates with consistent styling
✅ Individual view functions for each mode
✅ Component architecture preserved in dashboard
✅ Three-column responsive layout preserved in child profiles
