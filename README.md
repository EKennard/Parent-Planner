## ÔøΩ Deployment

**Live Application:** [parentplanner-0a7a2e9a2998.herokuapp.com](https://parentplanner-0a7a2e9a2998.herokuapp.com)

The ParentPlanner application is deployed and accessible using the Heroku Cloud Platform for reliable hosting and scalability. The production environment utilises PostgreSQL through Heroku Postgres for robust data management, while WhiteNoise middleware provides efficient static file serving that ensures fast loading times for CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.

### üìù Heroku Deployment Process
The deployment process begins with ensuring all prerequisites are met, including having a Heroku account with the Heroku CLI installed, a Git repository with all code properly committed, a complete requirements.txt file listing all dependencies, and a Procfile configured for Heroku process management.

The deployment workflow starts with creating the Heroku application using heroku create parentplanner-app, followed by adding a PostgreSQL database through heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev for data persistence. Environment variables are configured securely using heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here and heroku config:set DEBUG=False to ensure production security settings.

Application deployment occurs through git push heroku main, which automatically builds and deploys the application to Heroku's infrastructure. Database setup is completed by running migrations with heroku run python manage.py migrate and creating an administrative user through heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser. Finally, static files are collected and optimised using heroku run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput to ensure all CSS, JavaScript, and image files are properly served.

### üìù Local Development Setup
Local development begins by cloning the repository using git clone https://github.com/EKennard/Parent-Planner.git followed by navigating to the project directory with cd Parent-Planner. A virtual environment is created and activated using python -m venv venv and source venv/bin/activate on Unix systems or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows systems to isolate project dependencies.

Dependencies are installed through pip install -r requirements.txt, which ensures all necessary packages are available for local development. Environment configuration requires creating an env.py file in the root directory containing the secret key and debug settings for local development security.

Database setup involves running python manage.py makemigrations to prepare database changes, python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the local SQLite database, and python manage.py createsuperuser to create an administrative account for accessing the Django admin interface. The development server is started using python manage.py runserver, making the application accessible at the local development address.

### üìù Production Configuration
The production environment implements comprehensive security measures including CSRF protection with trusted origins configured for the Heroku domain. PostgreSQL provides reliable data persistence and supports the application's growing data requirements, while WhiteNoise middleware ensures efficient static file serving without requiring a separate content delivery network. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI server for production deployment, providing robust performance and concurrent request handling. Environment variables are managed securely through Heroku config vars, ensuring sensitive information like secret keys and database credentials remain protected while being accessible to the application.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
- Email notification system (planned for future release)
- Monthly calendar view (in development)
- Export functionality for family schedules
- Recurring events support
- Multi-user family sharing capabilities

## üîç HTML/CSS Validation Issues

The following validation issues have been identified and categorized for future resolution:

### CSS Issues
- **Line-clamp Property Warnings**: The CSS validator reports that `line-clamp` property doesn't exist. These warnings are expected as the application uses `-webkit-line-clamp` for cross-browser text truncation compatibility. The CSS validator doesn't recognize this modern Tailwind CSS utility.
- **Tailwind CSS Utilities**: Various Tailwind CSS utilities may not be recognized by standard CSS validators but are intentionally used for rapid development and consistency.

### HTML Issues  
- **Duplicate IDs Between Views**: The dashboard contains duplicate element IDs between mobile swipe view and desktop grid view (e.g., `events-section-heading`, `tasks-section`, `event-title-48`). This occurs because component templates are included in both views. Future fix will implement context-aware component IDs.
- **Unnecessary Role Attributes**: HTML validator reports unnecessary `role` attributes on semantic elements (nav, main, ul). These are intentionally added for enhanced accessibility support and screen reader compatibility, following WCAG guidelines.
- **ARIA Label Warnings**: Validator suggests possible misuse of `aria-label` attributes. These labels provide essential context for screen readers and assistive technologies, improving accessibility for users with disabilities.

### Accessibility Enhancements
- **Enhanced Screen Reader Support**: The application includes extensive ARIA labels and role attributes beyond HTML5 semantic requirements to ensure comprehensive accessibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Additional markup supports keyboard-only navigation patterns for improved usability.
- **Screen Reader Context**: ARIA labels provide context that isn't visually apparent but is crucial for assistive technology users.

### Resolution Timeline
- **High Priority**: Duplicate ID issues will be resolved by implementing dynamic ID generation in component templates.
- **Medium Priority**: CSS validation warnings are acceptable as they reflect modern CSS features and Tailwind utilities.
- **Low Priority**: ARIA and role attribute warnings reflect intentional accessibility enhancements and will be retained.
